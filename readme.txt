Drivr lets you access docs and files from your Google Drive account and help you to add them straight to your WordPress website securely and safely.

[View Demo](http://dev.awsm.in/innovations/drivr-google-drive-plugin/)


Drivr uses Google Picker API - the most recommended and seamless method to access your Google Drive files. It is integrated seamlessly into the post editor. With a click on ‘Add From Drive’ button it lets you access your Google Drive Account in a Modal Window, which actually is known as Google Drive Picker.

What makes Drivr stands out is the way it handles different type of files. If you choose an image file, you will get a friendly interface to add it into content editor just like WordPress\' default Media Library. If you choose a media file or a document Drivr will ask you if you want to embed it to your website.

= Can I remove download/popout buttons from the embed? =

Unfortunately we do not have the privilege to alter any features and options that comes by default with the Google Drive Embed, including the download button.

= Google Drive popup shows an error. =

Usually errors show up when the API settings are not configured properly. In that case, please double-check the API configurations with [the steps] (http://awsm.in/drivr-documentation/#cloudapi) . Make sure you have enabled Drive API and Google Picker API in API Manager. If it’s still not working, try generating a new API key and client ID.
